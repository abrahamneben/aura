Aura is a modern, header-only C++ library for accelerator development. Aura 
works with both OpenCL and CUDA backends. The Aura API is not stable yet (alpha
version).

## Concepts

Aura has only a few core concepts:

The `device` type is the starting point for all interactions with accelerators. It represents the device context known from OpenCL and CUDA. 

There are two layers of abstraction for memory management. A typed pointer to device memory `device_ptr<T>` is the low level memory abstraction. The type contains a raw pointer that represents a location in accelerator memory and a reference to a `device`. To enable pointer arithmetic, the OpenCL implementation of `device_ptr<T>` also contains an offset from the base pointer.

~~~{.cpp}
device d(0);
device_ptr<int> ptr = device_malloc<int>(16, d);
device_free(ptr);
~~~

The second memory management layer provides containers. A `device_array<T>` extends the `device_ptr<T>` type with the `bounds` type. `bounds` defines a multidimensional discrete space. A `device_array<T>` represents a continuous block of device memory of size ![bounds](https://raw.github.com/sschaetz/aura/develop/thoughts/bounds_formula.png).

~~~{.cpp}
device d(0);
device_array<int> array1(40, d);
device_array<int> array2(bounds(40, 20, 10), d);
~~~

Commands such as memory transfers and kernel invocations are issued to an accelerator through `feeds`. A `feed` is a queue of commands that specifies both location and order of execution of commands. A `feed` is always associated with a single `device`. There can exists multiple `feeds` for each `device`. Commands issued to different `feeds` of the same `device` execute concurrently and in the same memory address space. If supported by the accelerator, concurrent commands can execute in parallel. The `wait_for` function and `wait` method block the caller until all commands issued to a feed have finished.

~~~{.cpp}
std::vector<float> src(product(bounds(40, 20)));
device d(0);
device_array<float> dst(bounds(40, 20), d);
feed f(d);
copy(src, dst, f);
f.wait(); /* blocking until copy finished */
wait_for(f); /* alternative to f.wait(); */
~~~

The `copy` function is the only function required to transfer data between host and accelerator and between accelerators. Since the compiler can discriminate between accelerator and host memory, the correct `copy` function is dispatched at compile time. Both an iterator/pointer based and a range based interface are supported.

~~~{.cpp}
copy(src.begin(), src.end(), dst.begin(), f);
copy(src, dst, f);
~~~

Both CUDA and OpenCL define the number of accelerator threads for each kernel invocation. These threads can be partitioned into groups that communicate among themselves to some degree. How the total number of running threads is calculated is different in CUDA and OpenCL. The following table shows that CUDA calculates the size of the kernel space as level 1 partitioning times level 2 partitioning. In OpenCL, the kernel space and the level 3 partitioning are equivalent. The table further shows the nomenclature proposed in the Aura library. 

                 |  OpenCL      |  CUDA         |  Aura 
-----------------|--------------|---------------|------------
 smallest entity |  work item   |  thread       |  fiber    
 level 1         |  local work  |  block        |  bundle   
 level 2         |  global work |  grid         |  mesh     
 kernel space    |  global work |  grid * block |  mesh      



The `invoke` function parameterizes and enqueues kernels in a feed. Its first argument is a `kernel` object created from a `module`. The second argument specifies the number of `fibers` that should be launched using a `mesh`. The third argument partitions the `mesh` in `bundles` of `fibers`. The fourth argument is a tuple
containing arguments that should be passed to the kernel. The last argument specifies the `feed` the kernel should be enqueued in.

~~~{.cpp}
int xdim = 128; int dimy = 64;
device d(0);
module m = create_module_from_file("k.cl", d);
kernel k = create_kernel(m, "simple_add");
device_array<int> v(bounds(xdim, dimy), d);
feed f(d);
invoke(k, mesh(dimy, dimx), bundle(dimx), args(vec.data()), f);
wait_for(f);
~~~

If the space of `fibers` can be partitioned arbitrarily, that is, if the kernel contains no synchronization points, kernel invocation can be simplified. The `invoke` function can determine how to best partition the `fiber`-space based on platform properties and heuristics.

~~~{.cpp}
invoke(k, bounds(dimx, dimy), args(v.data()), f);
/* or: */
invoke(k, v.get_bounds(), args(v.data()), f);
~~~

A `mark` allows orchestrating and synchronizing multiple `feeds`. A `mark` is inserted into a `feed`. It can either be waited for from the calling thread or another `feed` can be instructed to wait for a mark through its `continue_when` member.

~~~{.cpp}
device d(0);  
feed f1(d);
feed f2(d);
mark m1;
insert(f1, m1);
/* or: */
mark m2(f2);
wait_for(m1);
f1.continue_when(m2);
~~~

## FFT

Aura provides a wrapper for the cuFFT and clFFT libraries. 

~~~{.cpp}
bounds b(128, 128);
std::vector<std::complex<float>> hv0(product(b), std::complex<float>(41., 42.));

// upload to device
device_array<cfloat> dv0(b, d);
device_array<cfloat> dv1(b, d);
copy(hv0, dv0, f);

// calculate inverse transform
fft_initialize();
fft fh(d, f, b, fft::type::c2c);
fft_inverse(dv0, dv1, fh, f);
fft_terminate();

// download from device
std::vector<cfloat> hv1(product(b), cfloat(0.0, 0.0));
copy(dv1, hv1, f);
wait_for(f);
~~~

Aura contains also a wrapper for FFTW. The code to call FFTW is very similar to the accelerator FFT library wrapper:

~~~{.cpp}
bounds b(128, 128);
std::vector<std::complex<float>> in(product(b), std::complex<float>(41., 42.));
std::vector<std::complex<float>> out(product(b), std::complex<float>(0., 0.));

// calculate inverse transform
fftw::fft_initialize();
fftw::fft fh(b, fftw::fft::type::c2c);
fftw::fft_inverse(in, out, fh);
fftw::fft_terminate();
~~~
